# Oriion ✨
Oriion is an accountability chrome extension developed to reduce the low retention rates of self-paced online courses.

## The Stats 📊
- Massively open online courses (MOOCs) are a rapidly growing [$8 billion market](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5240206/massive-open-online-course-mooc-market-by?utm_source=BW&utm_medium=PressRelease&utm_code=n7p5s4&utm_campaign=1513081+-+%2467.18+Billion+Massive+Open+Online+Course+(MOOC)+Market+-+Global+Forecast+to+2026&utm_exec=chdo54prd).
- MOOCs, in theory, are a great solution to the increasing inaccessibility of education (already sky-high tuitions increasing at [twice the rate of inflation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2020/08/31/college-tuition-is-rising-at-twice-the-inflation-rate-while-students-learn-at-home/?sh=1c9a46ab2f98)).
- But in practice, [only 4% of students enrolled actually complete them](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330316898_The_MOOC_pivot), and the average student does not make it more than [1/3 of the way through](https://might-could.com/essays/online-classes-dont-work/#:~:text=Udemy%20reports%20that%20the%20average,never%20even%20start%20the%20course!) before giving up.

## The Causes 👨‍💻
I sent out a survey to look at the reasons behind these low completion rates, and the following are the three most commonly reported culprits:
- **70%** of respondents responded "**the course did not take priority over other things on my to-do list"** as their either one or two top reasons for not progressing further in an online course
- **50%** of respondents responded "**I lost motivation to progress further through the course"** as their top one or two reason for not progressing further in an online course
- **31.3%** checked off **"I felt isolated taking the course on my own"** as a reason why they have not completed or progressed very far in an online course

## The Solution 👩‍🚀
A platform that incentivizes students to prioritize their online course, while maintaining their motivation, and keeping them accountable and not isolated.

After reading (okay, skimming) a handful of articles, books and studies on motivation, education and accountability, I came up with a few easy-to-implement features and mapped them on a value-complexity graph. 
The four features in the high value, low complexity quadrant came together nicely to fit a theme of an **online course accountability tracker**. And that's exactly what I designed the MVP to be – more updates to come once it's been deployed to the Chrome Web Store 🚀
